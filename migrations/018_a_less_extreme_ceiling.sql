-- SPEC 7.8-7.12, A74. A VIEW REPLACEMENT AND NOTHING ELSE, as 010-016 were.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- [A74] The high anchor moves from the 99.8th percentile of blended_merit to the 99th.
-- The low anchor (2nd percentile) is UNCHANGED.
--
-- Found by counting, not by feel: with the ceiling at p99.8, 82% of the 3,337 cards in the
-- deck (2,746 of them) read 70-79, 16% (539) read 80-89, and only 1.6% (52) ever reach the
-- 90s. That is a direct, measured consequence of where p99.8 sits -- 11.66 raw merit -- a
-- value set almost entirely by a handful of legendary outlier seasons (Gayle 2011/2012 among
-- them, already named in A58). The middle 50% of ALL player-seasons spans only -0.53 to
-- +1.81, a 17%-wide sliver of the (lo, hi) interval the scale stretches across 70-99, which
-- is the arithmetic reason the deck piles up on a single point (74) rather than spreading.
--
-- The two mechanisms that might have been expected to fix this do not, and are recorded here
-- so the question is not re-asked the next time the deck feels bottom-heavy. Season-relative
-- centring (A42/A68) removes ERA drift only; it does not touch the SHAPE of the distribution
-- within a season. Reputation (A57/A67/A69) is a FLOOR, not a boost -- it can lift a strong
-- career player's thin or bad season toward his own average, but it cannot manufacture a good
-- season out of a player whose career average is itself ordinary, which is most of any squad.
--
-- Raising the LOW anchor was tried first, on the reasoning that it would push the ordinary
-- middle of the pack up toward 80. Measured instead of assumed, it does the opposite: for any
-- player below the high anchor, d(fraction)/d(lo) = (merit - hi)/(hi - lo)^2, always negative
-- since merit < hi almost everywhere. Raising lo from p2 to p30 alone would have dropped the
-- MEDIAN player's card from 75 to 71. Recorded here as a wrong turn taken and corrected before
-- being shipped, not silently dropped -- the standing rule this file itself asks for.
--
-- Lowering the high anchor is the move that actually works, because it is the ceiling -- not
-- the floor -- that is stretched far past where the bulk of the data sits. Swept from p99.8
-- down to p90 and measured at each step: p99 was chosen as the point that meaningfully thins
-- the 70s band (82% -> 68%) and more than doubles the 80s band (16% -> 26%) while barely
-- touching the top -- 36 cards pinned at the 99 ceiling against 8 today, still a small,
-- genuinely rare group, not the quarter of the whole deck a cutoff as low as p90 would flatten
-- together. A ratified game-design choice, not a re-measurement of anything -- same category
-- as REPUTATION, ALLROUNDER_RUNS and the anchors themselves.

comment on view player_season_rating is
    'SPEC 7.8-7.12 rating. EVERY squad member is rated (A65 rates every player-season that faced or bowled a ball; A71 covers the 4 of 3,337 who did neither, from reputation alone or the scale floor if they have none). Runs above par per match (A54), disciplines added (A55), Player of the Match priced in (A56), a continuous all-rounder term (A59), shrunk on MATCHES for the per-match quantity (A66), with the career acting as a FLOOR rather than a blend (A67/A69, convex). Integer 70-99, anchored at the 2nd and 99TH percentiles of blended merit (A74 lowered the high anchor from the 99.8th -- see the file header). k = 100 balls, K_MATCHES = 6, POTM_RUNS = 12, ALLROUNDER_RUNS = 5, CAREER_FLOOR = 0.85 (convex, A69), CAREER_N = 2 and the anchors live here and nowhere else. Season means and cohort offsets are estimated on gate-passing seasons and applied to all (A68). `not_rateable_reason = ''no_evidence''` and `prior_source = ''reputation_floor''` mark the A71 branch.';
